# Facial-Recognition-System
"A deep learning-based facial recognition system for detection, recognition, and authentication."

Facial Recognition System is a deep learning-based project designed for real-time face detection and recognition. It leverages advanced machine learning models like MTCNN and FaceNet/DeepFace to accurately identify individuals. The system can be used for various applications, including automated attendance, security surveillance, user authentication, and criminal identification. Built with Python, OpenCV, TensorFlow, and Flask, this project integrates both backend and frontend components to create a seamless, efficient, and scalable facial recognition solution.
